:::note CodeGPT: Comment CodeGPT

Automatic Comments:
CodeGPT can add comments to your code for you, so you don’t have to do it manually. This saves time and keeps your code easy to understand.

Smart Explanations:
It doesn’t just say what the code does — it explains why things are written a certain way, like what a function is for or why a variable is used.

Better Code Quality:
Clear comments make your code easier to read, fix, and update later.

Helps You Learn:
If you’re looking at code you don’t understand, CodeGPT’s comments can help you figure it out — like having a tutor explain it to you.

Easy to Use in VS Code:
It’s built into the CodeGPT extension for VS Code. Just highlight some code and choose the "Comment" option to get started.
