Automatic Comments:
CodeGPT can add comments to your code for you, so you don’t have to do it manually. This saves time and keeps your code easy to understand.

It doesn’t just say what the code does — it explains why things are written a certain way, like what a function is for or why a variable is used.

Better Code Quality:
Clear comments make your code easier to read, fix, and update later.

Helps You Learn:
If you’re looking at code you don’t understand, CodeGPT’s comments can help you figure it out — like having a tutor explain it to you
