## Codebase Indexing
The Codebase Indexing feature allows you to index your codebase and use it as context for your conversations. In the main menu, you can find the `Codebase` button. Click on it to see the Augmented Context options.

You might ask what the difference is between Codebase Indexing and simply highlighting text for context. Here's a quick guide on why you might choose to use each:

Use Highlighting When:
- You‚Äôre focused on a small snippet or specific bug
- You don‚Äôt want to give access to your whole project
- You need quick, one-off explanations

Use Codebase Indexing When:
- You want CodeGPT to understand and work with your entire project
- You need context-aware suggestions, navigation, or implementations
- You're working on larger features, refactors, or debugging across files
- You want access to more advanced tools like Semantic Search and Knowledge Graphs

### Codebase
Click on `Create Codebase Index` and select a target folder to start indexing your codebase.

With this feature, the agent will have access to the Semantic Search Tool, which allows you to search for code snippets based on their meaning.

### Repo Insight Agents
Click on `Repo Insight Agents` to connect your Knowledge Graph from CodeGPT Studio  and use it as context for your conversations.
